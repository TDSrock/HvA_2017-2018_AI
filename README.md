The AI repo consist of 3 excersizes of which one has a visualization built in unity.

# [](#header-1)The excersizes
#### [](#header-4)The Flocking Dead	
A zombie flocking program where we had to program flocking boids.
This excersize from a programming standpoint was an absolute joke.

#### [](#header-4)Binary Questions
An excersize in which we had to look into a binary tree code and finish it. This was done relativly simply.

I also decided to create a visualization for the binart tree in unity. Which essentialy made me re-make the Console application within Unity. Due to some lazyness in implementation there are some details in there done hastly. But they work so it's good enough for me.
There was a bug with text scaling that I couldn't resolve. I think it's due too the parent object of the text canvas suddenly scaling down causing certain letters and or words to dissapear from a text canvas item that is setto autoscale the text.
