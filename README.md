The AI repo consist of 3 excersizes of which one has a visualization built in unity.

# [](#header-1)The excersizes
#### [](#header-4)The Flocking Dead	
A zombie flocking program where we had to program flocking boids.
This excersize from a programming standpoint was an absolute joke.

#### [](#header-4)Binary Questions
An excersize in which we had to look into a binary tree code and finish it. This was done relativly simply.

I also decided to create a visualization for the binary tree in Unity. Which essentialy made me re-make the console application within Unity.
There was a bug with text scaling that I couldn't resolve. I think it's due too the parent object of the text canvas suddenly scaling down causing certain letters and or words to dissapear from a text canvas item that is set to autoscale the text.
